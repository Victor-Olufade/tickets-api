# tickets-api

I built this support-ticket application with basic functionality where users can register, verify accounts with an OTP, authenticate, create tickets, leave notes for admin and view responses.



The crucial thing for me was that I was able to use Redux & Redux Toolkit quite in depth for global state management instead of React's Context API which I've been used to.



For the server-side I used MongoDB, Express, and Node.
